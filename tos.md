title: Smolblog Terms of Service
---

**Please read this!** This is less of a legal contract and more of an upfront statement. The Smolblog service is _very_
young, _very_ under construction, and _very_ likely to break. As such, I, Evan, want to make a few things clear.

## Definition of service

"Smolblog" (as referenced in this document) is a service provided by Evan Hildreth that provides hosting for text and
images available to the public.

## Personal Data

Data you send to Smolblog can be anything from an image, a blog post, or some other information you send. This also
includes your email address, password, and anything else you use to authenticate yourself with Smolblog.

The Smolblog service is a hosted web service. While Smolblog will make every effort to safeguard the data it is holding,
leaks can happen because Smolblog is exposed to the internet, and as such, is susceptible to data leaks. These leaks can
happen by accident through a mistake on Smolblog's part, they can happen because a malicious actor took advantage of a
mistake and stole data, or they can happen for other reasons. Also, changes to the service can sometimes result in loss
of data. As such, especially in this beta period, we have a few guidelines around the data you send to the service.

- **You agree to use a unique password when creating your Smolblog account.** Do not re-use a password you have used
  elsewhere. This will protect you if Smolblog or another service is compromised.
- **You agree not to upload any data that should not be public.** While every effort will be made to safeguard data,
  leaks can happen. During the beta period, do not upload any data that would be harmful if made public. This includes
	phone numbers, locations, compromising photos, and the mean things you say about your friends behind their backs. If
	it would cause harm by being public, it is best _not_ to put it on Smolblog.
- **You agree not to use the Smolblog service to store irreplaceable data.** There are export options available, and it
  is your responsibility to use them to download and archive your data to your personal storage. While every effort will
	be made to prevent data loss, Smolblog cannot guarantee that data will be available in perpetuity.
- **You understand that site administration will have access to all data uploaded to the service.** Passwords are the
  only exception, as we only store password hashes in accordence with generally accepted security practices.

## Code of Conduct

Any time you bring people together, there are going to be clashes and misunderstandings. These are inevitable, but we
can avoid them by agreeing to talk with each other in good faith. Also, we should be good citizens of the internet and
not appropriate content that isn't ours. Finally, at least for now, Smolblog is choosing not to host explicitly sexual
or violent content.

- Give other people the same considerations you would want them to give you. Don't assume malice, especially when
  ignorance can be a factor. If tensions get too high, walk away.
- Repeatedly sending messages to or tagging a person, especially about a topic unrelated to the post you are replying
  to, is not allowed on Smolblog. Posting another person's personal information without their consent (doxxing),
	knowingly spreading false or dubious information about someone, or inciting others to harass someone are all
	prohibited.
- Smolblog is designed to link and embed links and media from other websites. If you are not the original creator of a
  work, link to it. Do not re-post, re-upload, or otherwise post to Smolblog content that is not yours, even with
	credit, unless the original creator has explicitly given permission.
- **Smolblog currently does not permit photorealistic sexual or violent content nor links to said content.** Smolblog
  does not have the resources to verify that the subject of explicit content has consented to having said content on the
	internet. As such, explicit content that is or could be mistaken for a photo or video of someone is not permitted.
	This includes artwork that is entirely fictional and/or "generated" as there is no reliable way for Smolblog to verify
	those claims.
- Do not use Smolblog to post material that advocates for violence or discrimination against a race, religion, gender,
  sexuality, or other broad group of people.
- Do not use Smolblog to post illegal content or otherwise break the law as these actions can, if not kept in check,
  jeopardize the survival of the service. This includes fraudently impersonating another person.

## No Guarantees

**The Smolblog service is provided on an "as-is" basis** and may change significantly, break, or be shut down without
notice. These are not desired outcomes, but they are possibilities.
